# jQuerySnake

Need to add a highscore system that saves the highest score and displays it.
Need to add media query for mobile
Need to add buttons for mobile version

When the game starts display 0 in the score box

If the user changes direction to a valid direction and then immediately back to an invalid direction it causes the snake to 'double back' on itself
